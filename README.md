# Rough Hands
Rough Hands - Store Page demo

## Overview

This is a demo page for the Rough Hands online store.

It is based on the WordPress WooCommerce plugin and their Storefront e-commerce theme.

Storefront is the default standard for WooCommerce and we are adapting it to the Rough Hands needs using this current child theme.

This child theme, again, was inspired by another official child theme, Boutique.

The idea is to stick to the standards whenever possible for better performance and future compatibility.

## Content

### Dynamic

All content is dynamic - coming from the WordPress Dashboard. No content chunks were inserted into the site through code.

### Products

There are six original demo products, and the rest imported from the WooCommerce sample data to make pagination work.

### Menu, Sidebar and Footer

They are all using content set up in the Dashboard and customized via the Appearance menu.
